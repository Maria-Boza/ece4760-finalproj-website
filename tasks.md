# Tasks

The group worked together for the most part to debug the system and talk through issues faced. The knn algorithm was obtained from ECE 5775 Lab 2, and the group made the necessary modifications to run it on the Pico. Eshita worked on formatting the training data to fit the array format needed to be used in the knn algorithm. Maria and Eshita worked on initially setting up the camera with Arduino. Maria worked on the decoder for the greyscale VGA display. Anya worked on serially sending data from Python to the Pico, and worked on getting the camera running through CMake.
