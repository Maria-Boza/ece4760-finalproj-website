* Decoder

    To be able to have a grey scale on the vga we created a decoder to send in the same voltage to all the red green blue pins. The decoder consisted of 3 different resistors that were connected in series with each other and output the voltage value to the VGA screen. The reason why we wanted a grey scale was because all of our images are black and white but when we compress the image to a smaller one that the algorithm uses we wanted to show the compression in grey scale. Here you can find the # [schematic](./schematics.md).
